# Hangman-game
Hangman game program in Python, written in November after only 2 months of Python learning. Yes! I am quite proud of my achievement ðŸ˜Ž

During a dojo, our trainer proposed us to program a hangman game. Some functions were already written by him (see corresponding files) and we were 5 to change every 2 mn to write code and try to build a program in an hour without the possibility to speak to each other. 

We didn't go very far that time but I wanted to take up the challenge and even more when our trainer talked about keeping scores and go even further than asked the first time. 
Here is the program. I only kept some little pieces of code from the dojo and the functions cited earlier that I modified as the adddedFrench comments in the drawing funcions are adapted to the program I wrote.  

I tested it but didn't have time to test it in real situation with friends or colleagues but that would be the next step. The points system, especially, needs to be tested to see if it is okay or if I have to think about it further (I had to stop working on this program to move on with my training as you can imagine ðŸ˜‰)
