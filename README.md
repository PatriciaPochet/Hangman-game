# Hangman-game
Hangman game program in Python

During a dojo, our trainer proposed us to program a hangman game. Some functions were already written by him (see corresponding files) and we were 5 to change every 2 mn to write code and try to build a program in an hour without the possibility to speak to each other. 

We didn't go very far that time but I wanted to take up the challenge and even more when our trainer talked about keeping scores and go even further than asked the first time. 
Here is the program I wrote (I only kept the functions cited earlier and some little pieces of code from our dojo). 

I tested it but didn't have time to test it in real situation with friends or colleagues but that would be the next step. The points system, especially, needs to be tested to see if it is okay or if I have to think about it further (I had to stop working on this program to move on with my training as you can imagine ðŸ˜‰)
